Code for SORTING images based on their size(in bytes) and size in real life(pixel occupancy) and SEARCHING.
version1: sorts in incresing order of bytes.
version2: sorts in increasing order of pixel occupancy.(Here input images should be of same resolution and should have black background for better relative comparision in real life.)
