# Algorithms-Project
Code for SORTING images based on their size(in bytes) and size in real life(pixel occupancy) and SEARCHING.
# version1: 
Sorts in incresing order of bytes.
# version2: 
Sorts in increasing order of pixel occupancy.(Here input images should be of same resolution(images from the same camera would be better), taken from same distance and should have black background for better relative comparision in real life.)



FYI to open .ipynb files download them and open them from google colab.
